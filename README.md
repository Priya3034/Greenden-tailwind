Greenden Tailwind is a beautifully crafted responsive website built using HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. The design is inspired by a nature and gardening theme, making it ideal for showcasing plants, eco-products, or green lifestyle content. This project was created as part of my practice with Tailwind CSS, focusing on layout structure, responsiveness, and modern UI principles.
